Room Booking Software
Created by Richard Currie [kurru@animeequation]

== ChangeLog version 2.1.0 ==

== New Features ==
* Periods now have names. This is purely a superficial effect. ORDER must be maintained. 
So if new periods are to be added, must be at end of the period list unless you are dealing 
with a system with no bookings or dont mind breaking the bookings already made by users
for the future. 

EG. 3 periods: P1 = 1, P2 = 2, P3 = 3.
If you want to add in Lunch between P2 and P3. Then the system would change to P1=1, P2=2, Lunch=3, P3=4. 
So people who had booked for the 3rd slot [P3] now are set for Lunch [the new 3rd slot] 

### ABOVE IS BAD! FOLLOWING IS GOOD! ###

If you want to add a lunch, you must add it to the end of the set
P1=1, P2=2, P3=3, Lunch=4

This is as Bookings are referenced to the nth Slot each day and are not ordered as to starting times.
